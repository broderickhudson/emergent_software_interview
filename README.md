# Introduction
Hello! This is my development challenge submission for Emergent Software. I will delete this after the interviewer looks at it, I just didn't know of a better way to make this viewable. I hope this doesn't expose the problem for future applicants.

# Important Note
This was my second attempt at this challenge. The description of the task was a very good fit for MVC, with the model being given, the view being the display of the software, and the controller doing the filtering, but I couldn't get it to work properly, so this solution is what I came up with in the time that remained (~90min). I can talk through my thought process and struggles if that is helpful at all, and given a second opportunity, I would do a handful of things differently. I figured it would be better to be assessed by a working deliverable than by half of a working project.

# Other Notes
- I included all of the packages and everything. I know that the point of packages.config is to make it so I don't have to do that, but I never want to assume that whomever is looking at my stuff will know how to get it to work, so I included it to be safe.
- The *About* page lists some of my challenges, things I could have done differently, and a bit of my process for developing this, and I am prepared to talk about it in more detail.
